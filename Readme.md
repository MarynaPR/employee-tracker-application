## Description :page_with_curl:

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are known as Content Management Systems (CMS). 
This code demonstrates a command-line application to manage a company's database of employees using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
MySQL2 package is used to connect to MySQL database and perform queries, the Inquirer package to interact with the user via the command-line, and the console.table package to print MySQL rows to the console. All queries are made asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a `.promise()` function on Connections to "upgrade" an existing non-promise connection to use promises.
